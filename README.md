# Zyl’s NixOS Config

Made with love, and some questions to @Krutonium  
Also some inspiration from their config!

## Machines

#### Naming Scheme?

  
Currently, my machine naming scheme theme is: {Subject to change} .  
I’m terrible at naming things anyway, so lets make it worse!

Of course the names I am assigning here are not what I actually refer to
them as, I refer to my machines as... nothing.

### Bishop

This is my gaming rig.

It is an Aftershock Vapor 15 Pro from 2019, which I worked to pay off my
first year of working there.

It has an nVidia 2070 max-q and a 9th gen i7 in it with a buncha RAM.  
I use it as my main power house.

### Carter

This is a secondary machine that is used more for productivity,
portability, and maybe eventually some light gaming.

## Repo Layout

### test1

a

### test2

b

## Pre-commit hook test

Does it work?
