\subsection{Machines}
\paragraph{Naming Scheme?}\mbox{}\\
Currently, my machine naming scheme theme is: $\{$Subject to change$\}$ .\\
I'm terrible at naming things anyway, so lets make it worse!

Of course the names I am assigning here are not what I actually refer to them as, I refer to my machines as... nothing.

\subsubsection{Bishop}
This is my laptop gaming rig.

It has an nVidia 2070 max-q and a 9th gen i7 in it with a buncha RAM.\\
I use it as my main power house.

\subsubsection{Carter}
This is a secondary machine that is used more for productivity, portability, and maybe eventually some light gaming.

\subsection{Repo Layout}
\subsubsection{test1}
a

\subsubsection{test2}
b

\subsection{Pre-commit hook test}
Does it work?
